<h1>How to read parameters</h1>

<p>All the information below is based on information gathered from the internet and personal experience.</p>

<h2>1. Software Version</h2>
<p>
The software version of the engine control unit (ECU) affects the frequency of DPF regeneration.
For example, in an Audi A4 B8, post-Dieselgate software versions are numbered: 9977, 9978, 9979, 9980, and 9981.
This leads to more frequent DPF regenerations (every 250-300 km).
The calculated soot mass increases at a faster rate compared to ECUs with lower software versions.
</p>

<h2>2. Oil Ash Residue</h2>
<p>
This value indicates the amount of ash filling the filter. This value is not burned off and increases with the vehicle's mileage.
Depending on the engine, this value is given in liters or grams.
For 2.0 TDI engines, the maximum ash fill value is 0.175L or 60g.
Exceeding these values may require filter replacement or cleaning, but not always.
It depends on driving style and routes.
</p>

<h2>3. Temperature Before and After the DPF</h2>
<p>
During normal driving, temperatures do not exceed 350°C.
With dynamic driving, the temperature can reach up to 450°C.
During regeneration, temperatures range from 550 to 700°C.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Passive Regeneration:</b> Occurs when the temperature exceeds 350°C. It may also happen at lower temperatures, resulting in a decrease in measured soot mass.</li>
<li><b>Active Regeneration:</b> Forced by the ECU. Minimum temperature should be 580°C. If this temperature is not reached, it may indicate a problem with auxiliary components.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To achieve correct temperatures, avoid aggressive acceleration and engine braking.
Maintain steady speed within 2,000–2,500 RPM.
</p>

<h2>4. Differential Pressure</h2>
<p>
This is the most important parameter for analyzing DPF blockage.
Pressure is measured before and after the filter.
For more details, refer to section 4.2 "Differential Pressure Test."
</p>

<h3>4a. Differential Pressure Offset</h3>
<p>
This parameter indicates sensor health. The value should be close to zero.
</p>

<h2>5. Kilometers Since Last Regeneration</h2>
<p>
Shows distance since last regeneration. Typically ranges from 200 km to 800–1000 km depending on vehicle.
After regeneration, this value resets to zero.
</p>

<h2>6. Soot Mass Calculated</h2>
<p>
This soot mass is calculated by the ECU. Regeneration usually starts when it reaches 14g to 24g.
It should always be higher than measured soot mass.
After regeneration, it drops to approximately 2.5–5g.
</p>

<p>
Vehicles used mainly in city driving tend to regenerate closer to 24g.
Highway driving may trigger regeneration earlier.
</p>

<p>
Vehicles with pre-Dieselgate software may trigger regeneration using cruise control.
If DPF temperature is about 300°C and calculated soot mass exceeds 14g,
regeneration may start within seconds or minutes.
